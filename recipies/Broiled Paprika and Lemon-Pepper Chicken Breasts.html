      <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>2 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
              <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
              <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped</li>
              <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat 
                  source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease 
                  a broiler pan with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
              <li>Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with 
                  remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each 
                  piece evenly on both sides with paprika, 
                  lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared 
                  broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over top, and 
                  sprinkle onions around the base of the 
                  chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.</li>
              <li>Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. 
                  Flip and continue to cook, checking often, 
                  until no longer pink in the center and the 
                  juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. 
                  An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                  the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
          </ol>
